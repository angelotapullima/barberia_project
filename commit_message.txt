feat: Implement comprehensive dashboard analytics and data seeding

This commit introduces significant enhancements to the dashboard, providing richer insights into sales and reservations, and includes dummy data for easier testing.

Backend Changes:
- Database Schema: Added 'reservations' table creation to `database.js`.
- Data Seeding: Implemented dummy data insertion for sales (with sale_items) and reservations in `database.js` to facilitate local development and testing.
- Sales API:
    - Added new route `/api/sales/summary-by-service` to fetch top-selling services.
    - Implemented corresponding controller and service logic for sales summary by service.
- Reservation API:
    - Added new routes `/api/reservations/count` and `/api/reservations/count-completed` to fetch total and completed reservation counts.
    - Implemented corresponding controller and service logic for reservation counts.
    - Reordered reservation routes to ensure specific routes are matched before general ones (e.g., `/count` before `/:id`).

Frontend Changes:
- Charting Library Migration: Migrated daily sales chart from Chart.js to Vue ApexCharts in `DashboardView.vue`.
- Global Chart Registration: Registered Vue ApexCharts globally in `main.js`.
- Dashboard Enhancements (`DashboardView.vue`):
    - Adjusted layout for daily sales chart and barber ranking to display side-by-side.
    - Added "Top Selling Services" bar chart to visualize service performance.
    - Introduced new cards for "Total Reservations" and "Completed Reservations" counts.
    - Integrated data fetching for new charts and counts from respective backend APIs.
    - Initialized `useReservationStore` for reservation data access.
- Store Updates:
    - Added `getSalesSummaryByService` action to `salesStore.js`.
    - Added `fetchReservationCount` and `fetchCompletedReservationCount` actions to `reservationStore.js`.
